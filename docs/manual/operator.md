## Overview of the ArtemisCloud Operator Custom Resource Definitions

In general, a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is a schema of configuration items that you can modify for a custom Kubernetes 
object deployed with an Operator. By creating a corresponding Custom Resource (CR) instance, you can specify values for 
configuration items in the CRD. If you are an Operator developer, what you expose through a CRD essentially becomes the 
API for how a deployed object is configured and used. You can directly access the CRD through regular HTTP curl commands, 
because the CRD gets exposed automatically through Kubernetes.

The following CRD's are available for the Operator and canbe found in the Operator Repository under *config/crd/bases/*

| CRD                 | Description                                                    | 
| :---                |    :----:                                                      |  
| **Main broker CRD** | Create and configure a broker deployment                       | 
| **Address CRD**     | Create addresses and queues for a broker deployment            |
| **Scaledown CRD**   | Creates a Scaledown Controller for message migration           | 
| **Security CRD**    | Configure the security and authentication method of the Broker |

### Operator deployment notes

This section describes some important considerations when planning an Operator-based deployment

Deploying the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that accompany the ActiveMQ Artemis Operator requires cluster administrator 
privileges for your Kubernetes cluster. When the Operator is deployed, non-administrator users can create broker instances 
via corresponding Custom Resources (CRs). To enable regular users to deploy CRs, the cluster administrator must first assign 
roles and permissions to the CRDs. For more information, see Creating cluster roles for Custom Resource Definitions in the 
Kubernetes documentation.

When you update your cluster with the CRDs for the latest Operator version, this update affects all projects in the cluster. 
Any broker Pods deployed from previous versions of the Operator might become unable to update their status. To fix this issue 
for an affected project, you must also upgrade that project to use the latest version of the Operator.

You cannot create more than one broker deployment in a given Kubernetes project by deploying multiple broker Custom Resource (CR) 
instances. However, when you have created a broker deployment in a project, you can deploy multiple CR instances for addresses.

If you intend to deploy brokers with persistent storage and do not have container-native storage in your Kubernetes cluster, 
you need to manually provision Persistent Volumes (PVs) and ensure that these are available to be claimed by the Operator. 
For example, if you want to create a cluster of two brokers with persistent storage (that is, by setting persistenceEnabled=true 
in your CR), you need to have two persistent volumes available. By default, each broker instance requires storage of 2 GiB.

If you specify persistenceEnabled=false in your CR, the deployed brokers uses ephemeral storage. Ephemeral storage means 
that every time you restart the broker Pods, any existing data is lost.

For more information about provisioning persistent storage in Kubernetes, see [Understanding persistent storage](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html)

## Installing the Operator using the CLI

This section shows how to use the Kubernetes command-line interface (CLI) to deploy the latest version of 
the Operator for ArtemisCloud in your Kubernetes project.

If you intend to deploy brokers with persistent storage and do not have container-native storage in your Kubernetes cluster, 
you need to manually provision Persistent Volumes (PVs) and ensure that they are available to be claimed by the Operator. 
For example, if you want to create a cluster of two brokers with persistent storage (that is, by setting persistenceEnabled=true 
in your Custom Resource), you need to have two PVs available. By default, each broker instance requires storage of 2 GiB.

If you specify persistenceEnabled=false in your Custom Resource, the deployed brokers uses ephemeral storage. Ephemeral 
storage means that that every time you restart the broker Pods, any existing data is lost.


### Getting the Operator code

This procedure shows how to access and prepare the code you need to install the latest version of the Operator for ArtemisCloud .

Download the latest version of the Operator from https://github.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-operator/tags

When the download has completed, move the archive to your chosen installation directory.
```shell script
$ mkdir ~/broker/operator
$ mv activemq-artemis-operator-0.18.1.zip ~/broker/operator
```

In your chosen installation directory, extract the contents of the archive. For example:

```shell script
$ cd ~/broker/operator
$ unzip activemq-artemis-operator-0.18.1.zip
```



### Preparing the kubernetes Environment

Switch to the directory that was created when you extracted the archive. For example:

```shell script
$ cd activemq-artemis-operator
```

Specify the project in which you want to install the Operator. You can create a new project or switch to an existing one.

Create a new namespace:

```shell script
$ kubectl create namespace  <project-name>
```

Or, switch to an existing namespace:

```shell script
$ kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace= <project-name>
```

Specify a service account to use with the Operator.

In the deploy directory of the Operator archive that you extracted, open the service_account.yaml file.

Ensure that the kind element is set to ServiceAccount.

In the metadata section, assign a custom name to the service account, or use the default name. The default name is activemq-artemis-operator.

Create the service account in your project.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/service_account.yaml
```

Specify a role name for the Operator.

Open the role.yaml file. This file specifies the resources that the Operator can use and modify.

Ensure that the kind element is set to Role.

In the metadata section, assign a custom name to the role, or use the default name. The default name is activemq-artemis-operator.

Create the role in your project.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role.yaml
```

Specify a role binding for the Operator. The role binding binds the previously-created service account to the Operator role, 
based on the names you specified.

Open the role_binding.yaml file. Ensure that the name values for ServiceAccount and Role match those specified in the 
service_account.yaml and role.yaml files. For example:
```yaml
metadata:
    name: activemq-artemis-operator
subjects:
    kind: ServiceAccount
    name: activemq-artemis-operator
roleRef:
    kind: Role
    name: activemq-artemis-operator
````

Create the role binding in your project.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/role_binding.yaml
```

In the procedure that follows, you deploy the Operator in your project.

### Deploy The Operator

Switch to the directory that was created when you previously extracted the Operator installation archive. For example:

```shell script
$ cd ~/broker/operator/amq-broker-operator--ocp-install-examples
```

Deploy the CRDs that are included with the Operator. You must install the CRDs in your Kubernetes cluster before deploying and starting the Operator.

Deploy the main broker CRD.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/broker_activemqartemis_crd.yaml
```

Deploy the address CRD.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/broker_activemqartemisaddress_crd.yaml
```

Deploy the scaledown controller CRD.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/crds/broker_activemqartemisscaledown_crd.yaml
```

In the deploy directory of the Operator archive that you downloaded and extracted, open the operator.yaml file. Ensure that the value of the spec.containers.image property is set to the latest Operator image for ActiveMQ Artemis , as shown below.
```yaml
spec:
    template:
        spec:
            containers:
                image: quay.io/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-operator:latest
```

Deploy the Operator.

```shell script
$ kubectl create -f deploy/operator.yaml
```

In your Kubernetes project, the Operator starts in a new Pod.

In the Kubernetes web console, the information on the Events tab of the Operator Pod confirms that Kubernetes has deployed 
the Operator image that you specified, has assigned a new container to a node in your Kubernetes cluster, and has started 
the new container.

In addition, if you click the Logs tab within the Pod, the output should include lines resembling the following:

```shell script
...
{"level":"info","ts":1553619035.8302743,"logger":"kubebuilder.controller","msg":"Starting Controller","controller":"activemqartemisaddress-controller"}
{"level":"info","ts":1553619035.830541,"logger":"kubebuilder.controller","msg":"Starting Controller","controller":"activemqartemis-controller"}
{"level":"info","ts":1553619035.9306898,"logger":"kubebuilder.controller","msg":"Starting workers","controller":"activemqartemisaddress-controller","worker count":1}
{"level":"info","ts":1553619035.9311671,"logger":"kubebuilder.controller","msg":"Starting workers","controller":"activemqartemis-controller","worker count":1}
```

The preceding output confirms that the newly-deployed Operator is communicating with Kubernetes, that the controllers for 
the broker and addressing are running, and that these controllers have started some workers.

It is recommended that you deploy only a single instance of the ActiveMQ Artemis Operator in a given Kubernetes project. 
Setting the replicas element of your Operator deployment to a value greater than 1, or deploying the Operator more than 
once in the same project is not recommended.

## Configuring the Liveness and Readiness Probe

The Liveness and readiness Probes are used by Kubernetes to detect when the Broker is started and to check it is still alive. 
For full documentation on this topic refer to the [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) 
chapter in the Kubernetes documentation.

### The Liveness probe

The Liveness probe is configured in the Artemis CR something like:

```yaml
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    size: 1
    image: placeholder
    livenessProbe:
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
```

If no Liveness probe is configured or the handler itself is missing from a configured Liveness Probe then  the Operator 
will create a default TCP Probe that will check the liveness of the broker by connecting to the web Server port, the default config is:

```yaml
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    livenessProbe:
      tcpSocket:
        port: 8181
      initialDelaySeconds: 30,
      timeoutSeconds:      5,
```

#### Using the Artemis Health Check

you can also use the Artemis Health Checker to check that the broker is running, something like:

```yaml
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - /home/jboss/amq-broker/bin/artemis 
        - check 
        - node 
        - --silent
        - --user
        - $AMQ_USER
        - --password
        - $AMQ_PASSWORD
      initialDelaySeconds: 30,
      timeoutSeconds:

```

By default this uses the URI of the acceptor configured with the name **artemis**. Since this is not configured by default
it will need configuring in the broker CR. Alternatively configure the acceptor used by passing the **--acceptor** 
argument on the artemis check command.


    NOTE: $AMQ_USER and $AMQ_PASSWORD are environment variables that are configured by the Operator
    
You can also check the status of the broker by producing and consuming a message:

```yaml
spec:
  deploymentPlan:
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
          - /home/jboss/amq-broker/bin/artemis
          - check
          - queue
          - --name
          - livenessqueue
          - --produce
          - "1"
          - --consume
          - "1"
          - --silent
          - --user
          - $AMQ_USER
          - --password
          - $AMQ_PASSWORD
      initialDelaySeconds: 30,
      timeoutSeconds:
```

The liveness queue must exist and be deployed the broker and be of type anycast with acceptable configuration, something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v1beta1
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: livenessqueue
  namespace: activemq-artemis-operator
spec:
  addressName: livenessqueue
  queueConfiguration:
    purgeOnNoConsumers: false
    maxConsumers: -1
    durable: true
    enabled: true
  queueName: livenessqueue
  routingType: anycast
```

### The Readiness Probe

As with the Liveness Probe the Readiness probe has a default probe if not configured. Unlike the readiness probe this is 
a script that is shipped in the Kubernetes Image, this can be found [here](https://github.com/artemiscloud/activemq-artemis-broker-kubernetes-image/blob/main/modules/activemq-artemis-launch/added/readinessProbe.sh)

The script will try to establish a tcp connection to each port configured in the broker.xml.
